Example 1:

Input: totalMoney = Rs20, costPen = Rs 10, costPencil = Rs5
Output: 9
Explanation: The price of each pen is Rs10 and the price of each pencil is Rs5.

- If you buy 0 pens,=>Remaining Money: Rs 20,now you can Either buy 0 Pencil or 1 Pencil or 2 Pencil or 3 Pencil or 4 pencil. i.e total 5 ways : (0,0) and (0,1) and (0,2) and (0,3) and (0,4)
